# Necklace

Welcome to the Necklace project site. This minimal Jekyll site lives in the docs/ folder so GitHub Pages can publish it when the repository's Pages source is set to "gh-pages branch /docs folder" or the main branch's docs folder.

This site uses the github Pages supported theme `jekyll-theme-primer`.

If you need a custom layout or assets, add them under docs/_layouts, docs/_includes, or docs/assets.
